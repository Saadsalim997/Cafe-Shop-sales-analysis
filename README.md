Sales Analysis of Coffee Cafe
Introduction and Project Brief:

Chris Dutton from Maven Analytics introduces the project, which involves creating a dynamic coffee shop sales dashboard.
The project uses transactional data from the first half of 2023 from three coffee shop locations in New York City.
The goal is to transform this data into an interactive dashboard to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for the business.

Objective 1 - Data Profiling and Preparation:
The first objective involves getting familiar with the raw data and performing basic quality checks.
Tasks include adding calculated columns for revenue, month, day of the week, and hour of the day.
The process includes using Excel functions like SUM, MONTH, WEEKDAY, and HOUR to manipulate and analyze the data.

Objective 2 - Exploring the Data with Pivot Tables:
This objective focuses on using pivot tables to explore the data and identify trends.
Tasks include creating pivot tables to show total revenue by month, analyzing transactions by day of the week and hour, and exploring product data.
The video guides viewers through the steps to create these pivot tables and interpret the results.

Objective 3 - Building the Dashboard:
The final objective is to design and build the dynamic dashboard.
This involves creating visualizations using pivot charts and customizing the dashboard to make it interactive and user-friendly.
The dashboard will help franchise owners make data-driven decisions to improve business operations.
